End-to-End Encrypted File Sharing Application

This repository contains an End-to-End Encrypted File Sharing Application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to securely share files with others while maintaining the privacy and integrity of the shared data.
The client and server applications are dockerized and deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/), a platform for hosting web applications. Dockerization provides a consistent and reproducible environment for running the application, while Railway simplifies the deployment process.
